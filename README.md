## Books API:

[Open Library API]( https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books)

[Internet Archive API]( https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php)

[Google Books API]( https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview)

## Main motive : 

TO provide an environment for book lovers to explore and find books of their interest.

They should be able to rate and review the books and authors they have read.

They should be able to start a discussion by making groups.

We will be making a renting system for the books.

### Warehouse: 

There will be warehouses which will have the books in different areas. 

And the user will be able to check if the book is available in the warehouse near them.

They will be provided with renting prices and a deadline to return the book.

There will be a queue for waiting users if book is not available.


### plans for future:

add warehouse
add renting system
add user uath (token)
